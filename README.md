## Pre-requisites

Node 10 or greater is required. Development for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode 9.4 or up, and will target iOS 9 and up.

You also need to install the dependencies required by React Native.  
Go to the [React Native environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), then select `React Native CLI Quickstart` tab.  
Follow instructions for your given `development OS` and `target OS`.

## Getting Started

#### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sagarkhanal07/RNComponentTest.git

# Navigate to clonned folder and Install dependencies
cd RNComponentTest && npm install

# Install Pods
cd ios && pod install
```

#### 2. Running React Native Project

Run this command to start the development server and to start your app on Android Emulator:

```
npm run android
```

Or, if you prefer iOS simulator:

```
npm run ios
```
